        I build mythic systems that encode trust, distraction, and communal prestige. Every game, relic, and layout is a broadcast artifact—ritualized for emotional clarity and founder resonance. From <strong>Squid Memory</strong> to <strong>ArcanaForge</strong>, I architect worlds where grit becomes legacy and every technical fix is a ceremonial pivot.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My platforms aren’t just functional—they’re emotionally resonant. I remix pop culture icons into founder relics, scaffold distraction mechanics into game flow, and compress portfolio layouts into minimal shrines. Whether it’s a trait overlay or a relic pulse, every asset is designed to signal identity, tension, and transformation.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I thrive on collaborative prototyping, strategic feedback, and ceremonial storytelling. Every correction is a myth-building moment. Every deploy is a legacy artifact. This isn’t just code—it’s a founder broadcast.
